# Webtask & Cloudinary

## Build an online contest using Auth0 Webtask and Cloudinary

We recently released a online [contest](https://codepen.io/cloudinary/full/LjqJEG/) to showcase our [Neural Artwork Style Transfer](neural-artwork.md) add-on feature of Cloudinary's APIs.

Our goal was to show developers how to quickly build an engaging and fun online contest using _**functions as a service** or_ **FAAS** and our APIs. Check out the [contest](https://github.com/cloudinary-developers/canadian-music-week-hackathon-guide-/tree/39a9b1c59498323c6876cd302c24ff20894ab40f/h%20ttps:/codepen.io/cloudinary/full/LjqJEG/README.md) and [leaderboard](https://faas-cloudinary.com/wt-60a287cd40c53f6e56bd60ac8922bc3e-0/style-transfer/view/no-token), follow the links below to review the code on our GitHub Gists.
